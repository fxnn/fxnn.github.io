Hello and welcome to my blog! This is my first post where I want to share a bit about what you can expect to find here.

## What I'll Be Writing About

As a computer scientist with a passion for both development and operations, I plan to share:

- **Technical insights** from my work with Java, Go, CI/CD, and TDD
- **Operations experiences** with Kubernetes, observability, and infrastructure
- **Personal reflections** on balancing technology with life in Brandenburg
- **Photography moments** captured during my forest hikes

## A Bit About My Journey

From my roots in Thuringia to my current home in Brandenburg, I've found that the best solutions often come from understanding both the technical and human sides of problems. Whether I'm debugging a complex system or capturing the perfect shot of morning light through the trees, it's all about patience, observation, and finding the right perspective.

## Looking Forward

I'm excited to share more stories, insights, and discoveries as I continue exploring both the digital landscapes of software engineering and the natural landscapes of the Mark Brandenburg.

Thanks for stopping by, and I hope you'll find something interesting in the posts to come!
