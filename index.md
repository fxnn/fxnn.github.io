## About Me

Hello! I'm a computer scientist with a passion for both sides of the digital world: from development (Java, Go, CI/CD, TDD) to operations (Kubernetes, Observability). Between lines of code and deployment pipelines, as a native Thuringian and adopted Brandenburger, I find balance hiking through the forests of the Mark Brandenburg and photographing special moments.
